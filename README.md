# Detecting whether the building damage was caused by Fire, Flood or Earthquakes
The model predicts if the damge to the building is caused by fire, flood, earthquake using google images. I used a convolutionary neural network (CNN) and a pretrained model to train a model using the Fastai library and get an accuracy of about 77%.
The 20200318firefloodearthfraud1.ipy is the model that gets a 77% accuracy using including the default data augmentation. The 0200318firefloodearthfraud1.ipynb model does not use data augmentation and gives an accuracy of about 75%
